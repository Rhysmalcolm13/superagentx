A Handler is a programming component that responds to specific events, conditions, or prompts by executing predefined
tasks or actions based on the input it receives. It contains the logic for managing particular operations, playing a
key role in organizing and carrying out tasks.

With the `BaseHandler` from `superagentx.handler.base`, you can create your own custom
<a href="/examples/create_handler" target='_blank'>handlers</a>.

Additionally, we also provide <a href="examples/handlers/aws/s3" target='_blank'>pre-build handlers</a> for various other
services and libraries.

Set up a RapidAPI key as an environmental variable and run the following code.
```python
export RAPID_API_KEY = "**************************"
```

```python
# pip install superagentx-handlers

from superagentx_handlers import WalmartHandler

walmart_ecom_handler = WalmartHandler()
```
