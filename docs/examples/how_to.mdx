Here's a step-by-step guide to creating a new custom handler in `SuperAgentX`, inheriting from `BaseHandler` (`superagentx.handler.base.BaseHandler`), to enhance and extend the system's functionality.

### Step 1: Creating a New Handler
Now, we will create a new class `FileHandler` that inherits from `BaseHandler`. This class will handle reading a text file
and filtering the contents based on a search query.

Here's the FileHandler implementation:
```python
import asyncio
import aiofiles

from superagentx.handler.base import BaseHandler
from superagentx.handler.decorators import tool


class FileHandler(BaseHandler):
    def __init__(self, file_path: str):
        """
        Initializes the FileHandler with the given file path.

        Args:
            file_path (str): The path to the text file to be read.
        """
        super().__init__()  # Call the parent class's constructor
        self.file_path = file_path  # Store the file path for later use
```
### Step 2: Define Handler Method(s).
Now, letâ€™s define a method inside the handler to perform an action, like processing data from the given method.
This `tool` (`superagentx.handler.decorators.tool`) decorator is used to preserve llm tool function
when you wrap it in a new function, often used in custom decorators.

<Tip>
Write a docstring for the method based on the parameters provided. The docstring should be clear, detailed,
and understandable by an LLM (Large Language Model). The description should be 3 to 4 lines long with a brief
explanation, and parameter can be in a single line.
</Tip>

```python
    @tool
    async def read_file(self):
        """
        Reads the contents of the file specified by the file path.

        Returns:
            list: A list of lines from the file.
        """
         try:
            async with aiofiles.open(self.file_path, 'r') as file:
                lines = await file.readlines()
            return lines
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print(f"Error: The file at {self.file_path} was not found.")
            return []

    @tool
    async def search(
        self,
        query: str
    ):
        """
        Searches for lines in the file that contain the provided query.

        Args:
            query (str): The string to search for in the file.

        Returns:
            list: A list of lines containing the query.
        """
        lines = await self.read_file()  # Get lines from the file
        filtered_lines = [line for line in lines if query.lower() in line.lower()]  # Filter lines by query
        return filtered_lines
```

### Step 3: Testing the Handler
To test the FileHandler class, create a sample text file and use the handler to search for specific terms.

## create the sample.txt file
Create a file named `sample.txt` in the same directory as your script with the following content:

```text
Hello, welcome to the file handler example.
This file contains several lines of text.
You can search through it using queries.
The FileHandler will help you find matching lines.
```

### Use the `FileHandler` class to search for the term `"file"`:
```python
# Create an instance of FileHandler with the path to your text file
file_handler = FileHandler(file_path='sample.txt')

# Search for the term 'file' in the file
search_result = file_handler.search('file')

# Print the search results
print("Search Results:")
for line in search_result:
    print(line.strip())  # Strip removes the newline character
```

### Full Code
```python
import asyncio
import aiofiles


from superagentx.handler.base import BaseHandler
from superagentx.handler.decorators import tool


class FileHandler(BaseHandler):
    def __init__(self, file_path: str):
        """
        Initializes the FileHandler with the given file path.

        Args:
            file_path (str): The path to the text file to be read.
        """
        super().__init__()  # Call the parent class's constructor
        self.file_path = file_path  # Store the file path for later use

    @tool
    async def read_file(self):
        """
        Reads the contents of the file specified by the file path.

        Returns:
            list: A list of lines from the file.
        """
        try:
            async with aiofiles.open(self.file_path, 'r') as file:
                lines = await file.readlines()
            return lines
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print(f"Error: The file at {self.file_path} was not found.")
            return []

    @tool
    async def search(
            self,
            query: str
    ):
        """
        Searches for lines in the file that contain the provided query.

        Args:
            query (str): The string to search for in the file.

        Returns:
            list: A list of lines containing the query.
        """
        lines = await self.read_file()  # Get lines from the file
        filtered_lines = [line for line in lines if query.lower() in line.lower()]  # Filter lines by query
        return filtered_lines


# Create an instance of FileHandler with the path to your text file
file_handler = FileHandler(file_path='sample.txt')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Search for the term 'file' in the file
    search_result = asyncio.run(file_handler.search('file'))

    # Print the search results
    print("Search Results:")
    for line in search_result:
        print(line.strip())  # Strip removes the newline character

```

### Expected Output:
When you run this code, it will output:

```text
Search Results:
This file contains several lines of text.
You can search through it using queries.
The FileHandler will help you find matching lines.

```
