A Walmart handler is a tool that makes it easy for developers to connect their apps or websites to Walmart’s system.
With this tool, businesses can access Walmart’s product listings, prices, stock levels, and availability in real-time.
It helps automate tasks like searching for products, tracking inventory, and monitoring price changes.
This handler is very useful for e-commerce websites, price comparison tools, and inventory management systems.

## Walmart Handler Code
```python walmart handler
import os

from superagentx.handler.ecommerce.walmart import WalmartHandler

async def walmart_handler():
    walmart = WalmartHandler()

    return await walmart.product_search(
        query="best one blender provide 5 ratings"
    )
```
