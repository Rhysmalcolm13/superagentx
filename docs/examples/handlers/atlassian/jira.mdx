The JiraHandler class is a tool that helps developers easily connect to Jira and perform common
operations like creating, updating, and managing issues or projects. If youâ€™ve ever used Jira
for tracking bugs, managing tasks, or following project progress, this class makes it simpler
to automate those activities using Python.

## Jira Handler Code
The JiraHandler connects to Jira using an email, API token, and organization details. This setup allows the program to
interact with Jira, making it easy to manage tasks, projects, and issues programmatically.

 export ATLASSIAN_TOKEN = "*************"
 export ATLASSIAN_ORGANIZATION = "***************"
```

```python jira handler code
import os
import asyncio

from superagentx_handlers.atlassian.jira import JiraHandler

async def jira_handler():
    jira_handler = JiraHandler()

    return await jira_handler.get_active_sprint(
        board_id=1,
        start=0,
        end=50
    )
print(asyncio.run(jira_handler()))
```
