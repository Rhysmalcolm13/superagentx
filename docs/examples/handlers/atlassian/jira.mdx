The JiraHandler class is a tool that helps developers easily connect to Jira and perform common
operations like creating, updating, and managing issues or projects. If youâ€™ve ever used Jira
for tracking bugs, managing tasks, or following project progress, this class makes it simpler
to automate those activities using Python.

## Jira Handler Code

```python jira handler code
import os

from jira.client import ResultList
from jira.resources import Sprint, Comment
from requests.models import Response

from superagentx.handler.atlassian.jira import JiraHandler

async def jira_handler():
    jira_handler = JiraHandler(
        email=os.getenv('ATLASSIAN_EMAIL'),
        token=os.getenv('ATLASSIAN_TOKEN'),
        organization=os.getenv('ATLASSIAN_ORGANIZATION'),
    )

    return await jira_handler.get_active_sprint(
        board_id=1,
        start=0,
        end=50
    )
```

## Output
```python jira
[<JIRA Sprint: name='ASDF Sprint 27',id=20>]
```
