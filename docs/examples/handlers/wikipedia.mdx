A Wikipedia handler is a tool or library that simplifies access to Wikipedia's vast knowledge base.
It enables developers to retrieve and manipulate Wikipedia content programmatically, making it useful
for applications requiring summarized, factual, or historical information from the platform. This handler
streamlines interactions with the Wikipedia API, ensuring easy extraction of data such as articles, search
results, and metadata.

## Example
This code initializes a WikipediaHandler to retrieve a summary for a specified topic from Wikipedia. The query is
currently empty, meaning users can input any subject they want to learn about, and the handler will provide a concise overview.
```python wikipedia_handler.py
import asyncio

from superagentx_handlers.wikipedia import WikipediaHandler


async def get_summary(query):
    search = WikipediaHandler()
    return await search.get_summary(
        query=query,
    )


async def main(query):
    res = await get_summary(query)
    print(res)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    query="Sachin Tendulkar"
    asyncio.run(main(query))
```

## Result
```python wikipedia
('Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar ( ; pronounced [sətɕin teːɳɖulkəɾ]; born 24 April '
 '1973) is an Indian former international cricketer who captained the Indian '
 'national team. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the '
 "history of cricket. Hailed as the world's most prolific batsman of all time, "
 'he is the all-time highest run-scorer in both ODI and Test cricket with more '
 'than 18,000 runs and 15,000 runs, respectively. He also holds the record for '
 'receiving the most player of the match awards in international cricket. '
 'Tendulkar was a Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha by presidential nomination '
 'from 2012 to 2018.\n'
 'Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test match debut on '
 '15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went '
 'on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for over 24 '
 'years. In 2002, halfway through his career, Wisden ranked him the '
 'second-greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the '
 'second-greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards. The same year, '
 'Tendulkar was a part of the team that was one of the joint-winners of the '
 '2002 ICC Champions Trophy. Later in his career, Tendulkar was part of the '
 'Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, his first win in six World '
 'Cup appearances for India. He had previously been named "Player of the '
 'Tournament" at the 2003 World Cup.\n'
 'Tendulkar has received several awards from the government of India: the '
 'Arjuna Award (1994), the Khel Ratna Award (1997), the Padma Shri (1998), and '
 'the Padma Vibhushan (2008). After Tendulkar played his last match in '
 "November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office announced the decision to award "
 "him the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award. He was the first "
 'sportsperson to receive the award and, as of 2024, is the youngest '
 'recipient. In 2010, Time included Tendulkar in its annual list of the most '
 'influential people in the world. Tendulkar was awarded the Sir Garfield '
 'Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year at the 2010 International Cricket '
 'Council (ICC) Awards.\n'
 'Having retired from ODI cricket in 2012, he retired from all forms of '
 'cricket in November 2013 after playing his 200th Test match. Tendulkar '
 'played 664 international cricket matches in total, scoring 34,357 runs. In '
 '2013, Tendulkar was included in an all-time Test World XI to mark the 150th '
 "anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, and he was the only specialist "
 'batsman of the post–World War II era, along with Viv Richards, to get '
 'featured in the team. In 2019, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of '
 'Fame.')
