A weather handler is a tool or library that helps developers integrate weather data into applications.
It works by retrieving real-time or forecasted weather information from external sources, such as weather
APIs, and presenting it in a way that is easy to use in applications like websites, mobile apps, or IoT devices.

## Weather Handler Code
```python weather handler code
from pandas.core.frame import DataFrame

from superagentx.handler.weather import WeatherHandler

async def weather_handler():
    w_handler = WeatherHandler()

    return await w_handler.get_forecast_weather(
        location="Chennai",
        forecast_days=7,
        past_days=0,
        current=True,
        daily=True,
        hourly=True,
    )
```
