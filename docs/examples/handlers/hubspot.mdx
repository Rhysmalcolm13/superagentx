This HubSpotHandler class simplifies managing interactions with the HubSpot API, offering seamless methods for
creating, retrieving, and managing contacts, companies, deals, and tickets within a HubSpot environment. By
encapsulating common operations, it ensures that users can efficiently communicate with the API using both
synchronous and asynchronous workflows.

## HubSpotHandler Code

```python hubspot_handler_test.py
import os

from superagentx.handler.crm.hubspot_crm import HubSpotHandler

async def hs_handler():
    hs_handler = HubSpotHandler(
        token=os.getenv("HUBSPOT_TOKEN")
    )

    return await hs_handler.create_contact(
        email='',
        firstName="",
        lastName=""
    )
```
