The Serper.dev API provides a way to conduct real-time web searches, mainly leveraging Google's search capabilities,
and is useful for tasks requiring quick access to up-to-date information. It focuses on returning specific search
results, such as snippets and relevant URLs, making it ideal for developers who need web-based insights integrated
into their applications.

## Serper handler code

```python serper handler

from superagentx.handler.serper_dev import SerperDevToolHandler

async def serper_dev_handler():
    serper_dev_handler = SerperDevToolHandler()
    return await serper_dev_handler.search(
    query='Select the best city based on weather, season, and prices',
    total_results=1
    )

```
## Output
```python serper dev
