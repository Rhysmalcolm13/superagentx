The Financial Data Handler is a tool that helps get important financial information from online sources.
It allows businesses or individuals to easily access real-time data like stock prices, company financial
details, and income statements. This information can be used for tracking market trends, analyzing a
companyâ€™s performance, or making better investment decisions.

## Example
This code sets up a FinancialHandler to access financial data using an API key and specifies the stock symbol for Amazon
(AMZN). This allows for retrieving stock market information and other financial data programmatically.
```python financial_handler_test.py
import os
from superagentx.handler.financial_data import FinancialHandler

async def financial_handler():
    financial_handler = FinancialHandler(
        api_key="",
        symbol='AMZN'
    )
    return await financial_handler.get_stock_price()
```
## Result
```inline Stock price Output:
