These tools enable creators to produce, enhance, and automate content across multiple platforms.
LLMs play a crucial role in streamlining workflows, increasing efficiency, and delivering personalized
experiences to audiences.

## Example
This code sets up a content creation tool using a language model. The configuration specifies the model type and service
(OpenAI). The AIHandler uses the connected LLM (Language Model) client
to generate or process text content efficiently.

To use OpenAI models, you'll need to create an OpenAI account and get an API key. For more details refer <a href='https://platform.openai.com/api-keys' target='_blank'>here</a>.
>Set up a OpenAI API key as an environmental variable and run the following code.
 ```python
 export OPENAI_API_KEY = "**************************"
```

```python content_creator_handler.py
import asyncio

from superagentx.handler.ai import AIHandler
from superagentx.llm import LLMClient


async def content_text_create(instruction: str):
    llm_config = {
    'model': 'gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09',
    'llm_type': 'openai'
    }

    llm_client: LLMClient = LLMClient(llm_config=llm_config)
    content_creator_handler = AIHandler(
        llm=llm_client
    )

    result = await content_creator_handler.text_creation(instruction=instruction)
    return result.choices[0].message.content


async def main():
    instruction = input("Enter your instruction here: ")
    res = await content_text_create(instruction=instruction)
    print(res)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Result
```log content creator

Enter Instruction: create robusting content
