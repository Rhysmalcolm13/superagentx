These tools enable creators to produce, enhance, and automate content across multiple platforms.
LLMs play a crucial role in streamlining workflows, increasing efficiency, and delivering personalized
experiences to audiences.

## Example
This code sets up a content creation tool using a language model
(GPT-4o). The configuration specifies the model type and service
(OpenAI). The AIHandler uses the connected LLM (Language Model) client
to generate or process text content efficiently.
```python content_creator_handler_test.py
import asyncio

from superagentx.handler.ai import AIHandler
from superagentx.llm import LLMClient

async def content_creator_handler():
    llm_config = {
    'model': 'gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09',
    'llm_type': 'openai'
    }

    llm_client: LLMClient = LLMClient(llm_config=llm_config)
    content_creator_handler = AIHandler(
        llm=llm_client
    )

    result = await content_creator_handler.text_creation(instruction=instruction)
    return result.choices[0].message.content

instruction = input("Enter your instruction here: ")
asyncio.run(content_creator(instruction))

```

## Result
```log output
Enter Instruction: create robusting content
