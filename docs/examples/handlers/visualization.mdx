A visualization handler is a tool or library that helps developers and analysts create visual representations of data.
Its main purpose is to transform raw data into charts, graphs, and dashboards, making it easier to understand trends,
patterns, and insights. It serves as a bridge between complex datasets and easy-to-digest visuals, which are critical
for decision-making.

## Example
```python visualization.py
from superagentx.visualization import Visualize

async def visualize_handler():
    obj = Visualize()
    chart_data = [
        {
        "Apples": 5,
        "Pears": 3,
        "Nectarines": 4,
        "Plums": 2
        "Grapes": 4,
        "Strawberries": 6
    },
    {
        "Apples": 12,
        "Pears": 42,
        "Nectarines": 1,
        "Plums": 51,
        "Grapes": 9,
        "Strawberries": 21
    }
    ]
    await obj.pie_chart(data=chart_data, show_output=True)
```
