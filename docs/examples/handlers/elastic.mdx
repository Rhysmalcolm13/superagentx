Elasticsearch is a powerful, open-source search and analytics engine based on Apache Lucene. It quickly stores,
searches, and analyzes large amounts of data by creating indexes, rather than searching the text directly. With
a document-based structure and easy-to-use REST APIs, it processes and returns data in JSON format, offering
fast and scalable performance.

## Elastic search Handler Code

```python elastic_handler_test.py
from superagentx.handler.elastic_search import ElasticsearchHandler

async def elasticsearch_handler():
    elasticsearch_handler = ElasticsearchHandler(
        hosts="http://localhost:9200",
        username="elastic",
        password="password"
    )

    return await elasticsearch_handler.create(
    index_name="project8",
    document_id="project test",
    document={
        "@timestamp": "2099-11-15T13:12:00",
        "message": "GET /search HTTP/1.1 200 1070000",
    },
    )
```

## Output:
```inline Index Create Output:
{
  "_index": "project8",
  "_id": "project test",
  "_version": 1,
  "result": "created",
  "_shards": {
    "total": 2,
    "successful": 1,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "_seq_no": 0,
  "_primary_term": 1
}
```
