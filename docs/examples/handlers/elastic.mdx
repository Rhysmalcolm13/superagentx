Elasticsearch is a powerful, open-source search and analytics engine based on Apache Lucene. It quickly stores,
searches, and analyzes large amounts of data by creating indexes, rather than searching the text directly. With
a document-based structure and easy-to-use REST APIs, it processes and returns data in JSON format, offering
fast and scalable performance.

## Example
This code initializes an ElasticsearchHandler to connect to an Elasticsearch server running on localhost with specified
username and password. This setup allows for searching and managing data stored in Elasticsearch efficiently.
```python elastic_handler_test.py
from superagentx.handler.elastic_search import ElasticsearchHandler

async def elasticsearch_handler():
    elasticsearch_handler = ElasticsearchHandler(
        hosts="http://localhost:9200",
        username="<Elastic>",
        password="<Password>"
    )

    return await elasticsearch_handler.create(
    index_name="<INDEX_NAME>",
    document_id="<DOCUMENT_ID>",
    document={
        "@timestamp": "2099-11-15T13:12:00",
        "message": "GET /search HTTP/1.1 200 1070000",
    },
    )
```

## Result
```inline Index Create Output:
{
  "_index": "project8",
  "_id": "project test",
  "_version": 1,
  "result": "created",
  "_shards": {
    "total": 2,
    "successful": 1,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "_seq_no": 0,
  "_primary_term": 1
}
```
