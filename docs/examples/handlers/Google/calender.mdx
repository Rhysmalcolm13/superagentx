The Google Calendar Handler is a utility designed to simplify interactions with the Google Calendar API.
This handler enables users to authenticate, access, and manage their calendar events efficiently.
It provides methods for retrieving events for specific time frames, such as today, the upcoming week,
or the next month, as well as filtering events based on specific types.

## Example
A CalendarHandler for Google Calendar using provided credentials. This setup enables the application to manage calendar
events, schedule meetings, and interact with Google Calendar services programmatically.

To setup and get a credentials refer <a href="https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/quickstart/python" target="_blank">here</a>.

After creating and enabling the Google Cloud API, you need to provide the path to the credentials in the _credentials_ parameters.

``` python calender_handler.py
import asyncio

from superagentx_handlers.google.calender import CalenderHandler


async def get_today_events():
    calender_handler = CalenderHandler(
        credentials="<path-to-credentials>"
    )
    return await calender_handler.get_today_events()


async def main():
    res = await get_today_events()
    print(res)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Result
```inline Calender Today Event
{
    "kind": "calendar#events",
    "etag": "\"p32oftunmn22oe0o\"",
    "summary": "sam1234@gmail.com",
    "description": "",
