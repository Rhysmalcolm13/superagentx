The Google Calendar Handler is a utility designed to simplify interactions with the Google Calendar API.
This handler enables users to authenticate, access, and manage their calendar events efficiently.
It provides methods for retrieving events for specific time frames, such as today, the upcoming week,
or the next month, as well as filtering events based on specific types.

## Calender Handler Code

``` python calender_handler_code.py
from superagentx.handler.google.calender import CalenderHandler

async def google_calender_handler():
    calender_handler = CalenderHandler(
        credentials=""
    )

    return await calender_handler.get_today_events()
```
## Output:
```inline Today Event
{
    "kind": "calendar#events",
    "etag": "\"p32oftunmn22oe0o\"",
    "summary": "sam1234@gmail.com",
    "description": "",
    "updated": "2024-07-01T08:41:06.398Z",
    "timeZone": "America/Los_Angeles",
    "accessRole": "owner",
    "defaultReminders": [
        {
            "method": "popup",

        }
    ],
    "items": []

```
