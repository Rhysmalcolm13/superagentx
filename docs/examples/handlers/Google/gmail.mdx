The Gmail Handler is a specialized tool designed to interact with the Gmail API, enabling users to manage their
email accounts programmatically. This handler simplifies the process of accessing user profiles, sending emails,
and creating draft emails. It uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication and provides a user-friendly interface to perform
various email-related tasks asynchronously.

## Gmail Handler Code

```python Gmail_handler_test.py
from superagentx.handler.google.gmail import GmailHandler

async def gmail_handler():
    gmail_handler = GmailHandler(
        credentials=""
    )

    return await gmail_handler.get_user_profile()
```

## Output:
```python user profile
    {
    'emailAddress': 'bala234@gmail.com',
    'messagesTotal': 3678,
    'threadsTotal': 4352,
    'historyId': '985428'
    }
```
