The Gmail Handler is a specialized tool designed to interact with the Gmail API, enabling users to manage their
email accounts programmatically. This handler simplifies the process of accessing user profiles, sending emails,
and creating draft emails. It uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication and provides a user-friendly interface to perform
various email-related tasks asynchronously.

## Example
Set up a GmailHandler using the provided credentials, allowing the application to send, receive, and manage emails
through Gmail programmatically.

To create a new credentials follow the steps given in the
<a href="https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/quickstart/python" target="_blank">Google Cloud.</a> <br />
After creating and enabling the Google Cloud API, you need to provide the path to the credentials in the _credentials_ parameters.

```python Gmail_handler_test.py
from superagentx_handlers.google.gmail import GmailHandler

async def gmail_handler():
    gmail_handler = GmailHandler(
        credentials=""
    )
    return await gmail_handler.get_user_profile()
```

## Result
```python Gmail user profile
    {
    'emailAddress': 'bala234@gmail.com',
    'messagesTotal': 3678,
    'threadsTotal': 4352,
    'historyId': '985428'
    }
```
