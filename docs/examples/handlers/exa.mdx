Exa helps you locate precise content online using embeddings-based search. Its API offers three key features:

>**Page Search:** Find web pages through natural language queries, with an option to use traditional keyword searches if needed. <br /> **Content Extraction:** Access clean, parsed HTML from search results, with the option to focus on relevant sections using the highlights feature. <br /> **Similar Page Discovery:** Input a link to identify and retrieve pages with related content or meaning.

## Exa Handler Test Code

```python exa_handler_test.py
import os
from superagentx.handler.exa_search import ExaHandler
from exa_py.api import SearchResponse
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def exasearch_client_init() -> ExaHandler:

    # Set your API key as an environment variable
    exa_handler = ExaHandler(api_key=os.getenv("EXA_API_KEY"))
    return exa_handler

class TestExasearch:

    # Test async exa handler - search_contents method
    async def test_exa_handler(self, exasearch_client_init: ExaHandler):
        exa = await exasearch_client_init.search_contents(
            query="Topics in AI",
            search_type="auto",
            use_autoprompt=True,
            num_results=5,
         )
        assert isinstance(exa, SearchResponse)

```
