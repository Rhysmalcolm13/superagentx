Exa helps you locate precise content online using embeddings-based search. Its API offers three key features:

>**Page Search:** Find web pages through natural language queries, with an option to use traditional keyword searches
if needed. <br /> **Content Extraction:** Access clean, parsed HTML from search results, with the option to focus on
relevant sections using the highlights feature. <br /> **Similar Page Discovery:** Input a link to identify and retrieve
pages with related content or meaning.

## Example
This code sets up an ExaHandler to perform a search using an API key. It retrieves content based on the provided query,
automatically determining the search type and returning up to five results, making it easy to find relevant information
quickly.

```python exa_handler_test.py
import os
from superagentx.handler.exa_search import ExaHandler

async def exa_handler_search(query):
    exa_handler = ExaHandler(api_key="")

    return await exa_handler.search_contents(
        query=query,
        search_type="auto",
        use_autoprompt=True,
        num_results=5,
    )

query = input("Enter your query here: ")
asyncio.run(exa_handler_search(query))
```
