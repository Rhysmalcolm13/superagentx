Exa helps you locate precise content online using embeddings-based search. Its API offers three key features:

>**Page Search:** Find web pages through natural language queries, with an option to use traditional keyword searches
if needed. <br /> **Content Extraction:** Access clean, parsed HTML from search results, with the option to focus on
relevant sections using the highlights feature. <br /> **Similar Page Discovery:** Input a link to identify and retrieve
pages with related content or meaning.

## Example
This code sets up an ExaHandler to perform a search using an API key. It retrieves content based on the provided query,
automatically determining the search type and returning up to five results, making it easy to find relevant information
quickly.

To access ExaSearch services, you'll need to create an ExaSearch account, obtain an API key, and subscribe to the
 required API for your application. For more details, refer to the
  <a href='https://docs.exa.ai/reference/getting-started' target='_blank'>ExaSearch</a> documentation.

>Set up a Exa API key as an environmental variable and run the following code.

 ```python
 export EXA_API_KEY = "**************************"
```

```python exa_handler.py
import os
import asyncio

from superagentx.handler.exa_search import ExaHandler


async def search_contents(query):
    exa_handler = ExaHandler()
    return await exa_handler.search_contents(
        query=query,
        search_type="auto",
        use_autoprompt=True,
        num_results=5,
    )


async def main(query):
    res = await search_contents(query)
    print(res)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    query = "What is Agentic AI Framework?"
    asyncio.run(main(query))
```
