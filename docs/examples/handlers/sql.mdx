A SQL handler refers to a tool or interface that simplifies the process of interacting with SQL databases.
Its main purpose is to help developers run SQL queries, manage data, and connect to databases with minimal
complexity. It abstracts away repetitive tasks such as writing complex SQL syntax, handling connections,
and managing query results, making it easier to work with databases programmatically.

## Sql Handler Code
```python sql handler

from superagentx.handler.sql import SQLHandler
from sqlalchemy.engine.cursor import CursorResult

async def sql_handler():
    sql_handler = SQLHandler(
        database_type="mysql",
        database="<DATABASE>",
        username="<USER_NAME>",
        password="<YOUR_PASSWORD>"
    )

    stmt = "CREATE TABLE test9 (x int, y int)"
    return await sql_handler.create_table( stmt=stmt)
```
